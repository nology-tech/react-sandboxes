- Navigate to you choosen branch
- Run "npm install" in your CLI to add dependancies 
- Run "npm start" to launch Live server

## Available Branches

- main
- props-start
- props-finished
- mapping-over-data
- state
- functions-as-props-start
- function-as-props-finished
- data-request-use-effect
- testing

### Current Branch mapping-over-data
This is the only branch. Notes through the code.

#### Optional Steps
- Create a scores array => data source
- Recap on map syntax -> what you can use inside a map function
- Use a map to create an array of Player objects
- Create a ScoreCard component => this will take props from object above
- Map over the array of player objects pass the values as props for the component
- Talk about adding the key prop


#### Challenge

1. There is a data file in the data folder => [{data},{data}]
2. Create a reusable component to display each object in the array
3. Map over the data file and create a component for each object
4. Have fun and display it in the app
